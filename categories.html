        <p>
            Body mass index (BMI) is a medical screening tool that measures a person's height-to-weight ratio to estimate their body fat. It is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.
           <br> <br> For most people, body mass index is related to body fat. The higher the number, the more body fat they have. However, in some cases, this relationship may not be accurate. BMI alone cannot diagnose health conditions. Healthcare professionals use other tools and tests along with BMI to assess a person's health and potential risks.
           <br> <br> High body fat can lead to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Low body fat can be associated with malnutrition. Adequate body fat helps the body absorb vitamins and minerals. It also provides a source of energy, helps maintain body temperature, and protects organs.
